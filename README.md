# Notes:
BDD stands for Behavior Driven Development framework. I achieved BDD framework with the help of Cucumber tool.
Once I created the maven project it generated two main source packages as like src/main/java and src/test/java and there is one most important XML file is pom.xml. 
POM.xml is heart of maven project inside the pom.xml file here I added different types of dependency .
